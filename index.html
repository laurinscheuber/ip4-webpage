                    <h3>Initial Situation</h3>
                    <p>In January 2023, the FHNW Academy of Music in Basel hosted the international festival <strong>"SPIEL! Games as
                            Critical Practice"</strong>. This four-day event featured concerts, lectures, performances, and discussions,
                        critically exploring the creative power of play in addressing societal, technological, and aesthetic questions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The festival engaged a diverse audience, including students, educators, researchers, and professionals from fields
                        such as music, design, psychology, technology, and education. It was also open to the general public, inviting
                        anyone interested in the intersection of play and critical practice.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Purpose and Objectives</h4>
                    <p>The primary aim of the festival was to investigate the inherent creative power of playfulness and its impact on
                        various domains. By adopting a playful approach, it sought to shed light on critical societal issues and encourage
                        innovative thinking.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Anticipated Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>The festival aimed to achieve several goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Foster connections among various disciplines to explore the
                            multifaceted nature of play.</li>
                        <li><strong>Educational Enrichment:</strong> Provide valuable insights and knowledge to students and professionals,
                            enhancing their understanding of play as a critical practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> Encourage public participation in discussions about the role of play in
                            society, promoting broader cultural awareness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Despite its success, the festival's rich educational content was initially accessible only to a few attendees. To extend
                        its impact and make these resources available to a broader audience—including participants and the general public, a
                        platform is needed.</p>
                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    <p>The project's goal is to develop a platform that will not only preserve content for future audiences but also provide
                        a valuable resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in critical perspectives on games as a cultural
                        practice. By establishing a <strong>web-based archive</strong>, the platform will centralize the festival's content
                        in a single, accessible location. Additionally, the design incorporates an innovative approach to showcase the
                        <strong>connections between events</strong> through interactive, gamified elements.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://criticalgames.ch/">criticalgames.ch</a> is a thoughtfully designed web
                        application that
                        presents the proceedings from the festival in an
                        engaging, gamified format. Users can explore a diverse collection of videos, audio recordings,
                        and informative text from many of the festival's performances, including lectures, concerts,
                        and discussions. The platform introduces an innovative navigation system, displaying an
                        interconnected graph of events, speakers, and organizers, which allows users to explore
                        the connections between the festival's various sessions and topics.</p>

                    <p>This approach offers a unique, interactive way to engage with the festival's content,
                        transforming it from a series of isolated events into a dynamic, interconnected experience.
                        The solution stores all festival content securely on dedicated servers with backups, ensuring long-term
                        preservation and accessibility through a comprehensive web platform. This digital archive includes recorded
                        lectures, workshop materials, panel discussions, and interactive demonstrations that showcase creative approaches to
                        play-based research. The repository serves as a valuable knowledge base where researchers can explore methodologies
                        for integrating games into academic work, students can access expert insights on games as cultural artifacts, and
                        practitioners can discover innovative approaches to critical game analysis and design research.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>Testimonial</strong><br>
                        "I experienced the collaboration with the team of students and their coach as very dynamic,
                        innovative and mutually
                        beneficial. The almost one-year development period is worthwhile: in close collaboration, new
                        ideas and possibilities
                        also arise for the client - in my case, the project has helped me not only to publish my
                        research data, but also to
                        structure it sustainably. The students already have their own professional experience and the
                        mix of the team brings
                        together different fields of expertise, technology, data management and design, which has led to
                        a well-rounded and
                        refined end product."<br>
