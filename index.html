                    <h3>Initial Situation</h3>
                    <p>The University for music of FHNW in Basel hosted the festival <strong>"SPIEL! Games as a Critical
                            Practice"</strong> in January of 2023. This four-day event offered a wide range of different
                        performances
                        including lectures, concerts, vernissages and discussions. The Festival was a highlight for the
                        University
                        and produced a large amount of educational content. These proceedings were only accessible to a
                        small
                        number of people. Our customer therefore required a platform to present them to the public.</p>
                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    <p>Our goal was to create a <strong>web-based archive</strong> to present all the content from the
                        festival <strong>"SPIEL! Games as a Critical Practice"</strong>, in one publicly available
                        place. A second
                        objective was to show the <strong>connections between events</strong> in a gamified way.
                        As the client did not have a specific presentation in mind, the team had more creative freedom
                        than in other projects.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://criticalgames.ch/">criticalgames.ch</a> is a thoughtfully designed web
                        application that
                        presents the proceedings from the "SPIEL! Games as a Critical Practice" festival in an
                        engaging, gamified format. Users can explore a diverse collection of videos, audio recordings,
                        and informative text from many of the festival's performances, including lectures, concerts,
                        and discussions. The platform introduces an innovative navigation system, displaying an
                        interconnected graph of events, speakers, and organizers, which allows users to explore
                        the connections between the festival's various sessions and topics.</p>

                    <p>This approach offers a unique, interactive way to engage with the festival's content,
                        transforming it from a series of isolated events into a dynamic, interconnected experience.
                        The web application not only preserves the content for future audiences but also provides
                        a valuable resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in critical perspectives
                        on games as a cultural practice.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>Testimonial</strong><br>
                        «I experienced the collaboration with the team of students and their coach as very dynamic,
                        innovative and mutually
                        beneficial. The almost one-year development period is worthwhile: in close collaboration, new
                        ideas and possibilities
                        also arise for the client - in my case, the project has helped me not only to publish my
                        research data, but also to
                        structure it sustainably. The students already have their own professional experience and the
                        mix of the team brings
                        together different fields of expertise, technology, data management and design, which has led to
                        a well-rounded and
                        refined end product.»<br>
