                    <h3>Initial Situation</h3>
                    <p>In January 2023, the FHNW Academy of Music in Basel hosted the international festival
                        <strong>"SPIEL! Games as
                            Critical Practice"</strong>. This four-day event featured concerts, lectures, performances,
                        and discussions,
                        critically exploring the creative power of play in addressing societal, technological, and
                        aesthetic questions.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Target Audience</h4>
                    <p>The festival engaged a diverse audience, including students, educators, researchers, and
                        professionals from fields
                        such as music, design, psychology, technology, and education. It was also open to the general
                        public, inviting
                        anyone interested in the intersection of play and critical practice.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Purpose and Objectives</h4>
                    <p>The primary aim of the festival was to investigate the inherent creative power of playfulness and
                        its impact on
                        various domains. By adopting a playful approach, it sought to shed light on critical societal
                        issues and encourage
                        innovative thinking.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Anticipated Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>The festival aimed to achieve several goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Foster connections among various
                            disciplines to explore the
                            multifaceted nature of play.</li>
                        <li><strong>Educational Enrichment:</strong> Provide valuable insights and knowledge to students
                            and professionals,
                            enhancing their understanding of play as a critical practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public Engagement:</strong> Encourage public participation in discussions about the
                            role of play in
                            society, promoting broader cultural awareness.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Despite its success, the festival's rich educational content was initially accessible only to a
                        few attendees. To extend
                        its impact and make these resources available to a broader audience—including participants and
                        the general public, a
                        platform is needed.</p>
                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    <p>The project's goal is to develop a platform that will not only preserve content for future
                        audiences but also provide
                        a valuable resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in critical perspectives on
                        games as a cultural
                        practice. By establishing a <strong>web-based archive</strong>, the platform will centralize the
                        festival's content
                        in a single, accessible location. Additionally, the design incorporates an innovative approach
                        to showcase the
                        <strong>connections between events</strong> through interactive, gamified elements.

                    <h3>Developed Solution and its Benefit</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>During the first two sprints, we dedicated ourselves to extensive research and analysis to gain a
                            clear understanding of the term “Gamification” and its relevance to our project. We explored a
                            variety of creative approaches, such as developing a virtual 3D world where users could navigate
                            through recreated festival spaces or designing a remix tool that allowed users to reimagine
                            concert recordings in their own style, much like a DJ mixes tracks. Another idea resembled an
                            interactive lottery draw.
                            Despite this creative exploration, we initially struggled to find a unified direction as a team.
                            Diverging ideas led to a lack of consensus, creating the feeling of standing before an
                            insurmountable wall.

                        <p>A pivotal breakthrough occurred during a design workshop we conducted with the support of our
                            coach and an invited lecturer. On this day, we achieved a shared understanding as a team and
                            developed a central concept: Cluster View. This marked a turning point, as for the first time,
                            all team members had a collective vision and a clear starting point.</p>

                        <h4>Building the Foundation: Structure and Early Prototypes</h4>
                        <p>We began by organizing the collected data—such as events, performers, and relevant keywords—into
                            a comprehensive Excel sheet with input from our client. This served as the foundation upon which
                            we built the backend structure and quickly developed an initial graphical interface to begin
                            working with.
                    
                            The focus then shifted to implementing features and testing. Key functionalities we implemented
                            included a PDF downloader, a video player, and more complex elements like a navigable 3D cluster
                            for displaying nodes. The navigation bar and search functionality were continuously refined and
                            updated throughout the process.</p>
                    
                        <div style="text-align: center; flex: 1;">
                            <div class="materialboxed-wrap"><img src="images/Datenübersicht.png" class="responsive materialboxed hoverable" alt="Data overview in Excel"
                                style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; height: auto;"></div>
                            
                            <p style="margin-top: 8px; font-weight: bold;">Data overview in Excel</p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>The Design: A Clear Structure with Retro Accents</h4>
                        <p>Our initial plan was to refine the design after completing the core features. We had a design
                            concept in mind early on, but it sparked intense debates within the team. To streamline
                            decision-making, we created a design commission consisting of three team members. While everyone
                            could still share their opinions, the commission had the final say in design decisions.
                    
                            The final design captures the essence of our project, translating it into a cohesive visual
                            language: fine lines symbolizing the connections between nodes, retro-inspired typography
                            evoking a past era of technology, and a color palette brimming with retro aesthetics.</p>

                        <h4>Final Touches: Optimization and Handover</h4>
                        <p>In the final weeks of development, our focus shifted to optimizing the user experience and fixing
                            remaining bugs. We polished the final details to ensure a seamless experience for users.
                    
                            As the project drew to a close, we realized that wrapping up such an endeavor rarely feels
                            definitive. While there are countless opportunities to continue building on this foundation, it
                            was time to hand the product over to our client and bring the project to its conclusion.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>Testimonial</strong><br>
                        "I experienced the collaboration with the team of students and their coach as very dynamic,
                        innovative and mutually
                        beneficial. The almost one-year development period is worthwhile: in close collaboration, new
                        ideas and possibilities
                        also arise for the client - in my case, the project has helped me not only to publish my
                        research data, but also to
                        structure it sustainably. The students already have their own professional experience and the
                        mix of the team brings
                        together different fields of expertise, technology, data management and design, which has led to
                        a well-rounded and
                        refined end product."<br>
